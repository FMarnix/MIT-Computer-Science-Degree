# MIT-Computer-Science-Degree
A curriculum full with free courses from MITOpenCourseWare for a bachelor degree in Computer Science

This is my repository of courses for achieving a bachelor level education in Computer Science provided by MIT through their platform MIT OpenCourseWare.
The curriculum try to abrange all the fields require for a complete bachelor degree as the one. For elaborating this curriculum i used as base the [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), the article from Frederik Bussler in [Medium](https://medium.com/codex/take-mits-bachelor-s-of-computer-science-courses-free-online-d749a1e80045) and the [Degree Chart](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) for MIT Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3).
All the courses and equivalents will be available through the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) platform.

This is a guideline to help all the people to adquire knowledge in Computer Science for free from one of the most prestigious institutions in the world.
